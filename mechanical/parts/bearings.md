# Bearings & Bushings

Bearings and bushing are designed to constrain relative motion, and reduce friction between rotating parts. There are a wide variety of bearings available, those most commonly used in FRC designs are discussed below.

## Radial Ball Bearings

Radial ball bearing are the most common type of bearing used in all products. Normal construction is with both the inner and outer races having ball groves. Inside there are a number of ball bearing contained by cage. These bearing need to be lubricated with grease; in FRC we normally use sealed bearings that are pre-lubricated. Radial ball bearing are designed for radial loads, and some axial loads.

Because nearly all COTS gearboxes and wheels are designed around ½ inch hex or round shaft, the use of the deep groove inch size “R” bearings is an obvious choice. They are available with flanges (FR, typically used) and without (R) flanges. The most common used R8 size (0.5 inch ID, 1.125 inch OD) bearing are rated for 1000 pounds radial loads, and about 250 pound axial load. The most typically used FRC bearing are listed below.

##### Typical Bearings Used (R Inches Series)

| OD               | ID               | Name             |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 0.875 OD         | 0.375 hexagon ID | FR6ZZ-Hex        |
| 0.875 OD         | 0.375 round ID   | FR6ZZ            |
| 1.125 OD         | 0.375 hexagon ID | FR6ZZL-Hex       |
| 1.125 OD         | 0.500 hexagon ID | FR8ZZ-HEX        |
| 1.125 OD         | 0.500 round ID   | FR8ZZ            |



## Needle Roller Bearings

A needle roller bearing uses small cylindrical rollers rather than balls. Needle bearings can only be used for round shafts, but offer high radial load capacity in a smaller outside diameter package than a standard roller bearings. The small OD size can be advantageous when space is at a premium, such as supporting an inner shaft on a coaxial swerve drive.


## Tapered Ball & Roller Bearings

Tapered Bearings are designed for both Axial and Radial Loads. These are the type of bearings that are used on automobile wheels, and also used in the old cup and cone style bicycle wheels. The axial preload on the bearing needs to be adjustable. These are not commonly used in robotics due to the high cost and installation complexity of these bearings. For axial and radial loads, FRC teams typically use a combination of a radial bearing and a thrust bearing.


## Thrust Bearings

In locations where an axial load is applied, a thrust bearing is used to reduce friction. Depending on the load, there are thrust bearings with needle or ball bearings. For lower loads a simple “washer style” type of bearing made with bronze, Oilite™; Teflon™; or other plastics is quite sufficient.


## Bushings

Bushing are similar to bearings, but lack any roller elements. They are typically used in lower-speed applications and may have slightly higher friction. Bushings are widely available in bronze, Oilite, PFTE (Teflon), and Nylon and other plastics.
